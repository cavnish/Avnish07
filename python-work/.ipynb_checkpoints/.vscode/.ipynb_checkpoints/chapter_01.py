#A FUNCTION IS A REUSABLE BLOCK OF CODES THAT PERFORMS A SPECIFIC TASK ,INSTEAD OF WRITE SAME CODE AGAIN AND 
# AGAIN ,PUT IT IN INSIDE A FUNCTION AND CALL IT WHEN EVER NEEDED
#function created
def greetings():#WITHOUT PARAMETER
    print("Hello Dear,") 
def add2num(a,b): #PARAMETER
    result=a+b    #assinging a task or logical statements
    print("the sum is",result)
 #CALLING ABOVE  FUCTIONS BY IT NAME
greetings()
add2num(500000,25659)    #ARGUMENTS
add2num(a=23456,b=45663)

#THE RETURN STATEMENTS 
#THE RETURN STATEMENT USED IN A FUNCTION TO SEND A RESULT BACK TO THE PLACE WHERE 
#THE FUNCTION WAS CALLED .WHEN RETURN IS EXCUTED ,THE FUCTIN STOP RUNNING AND IMMEDIATELY
#RETURNS  THEBSPECIFIED VALUE.
#EXAMPLE
def add2numn(a,b):
    return a+b
    #ruturn a-b after return function statement function end
r=add2numn(78,85)    
print(r)
